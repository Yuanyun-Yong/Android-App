# Android-App

/*
This app is written in the Java language:

Description of app:
The app's function is to manage timetables. 
Users may be able to:
- Use different colours for events
- Set alarms for events 
- etc.
Note that the app:
- Allows easy addition of events
- Has an intuitive interface
- Allows users to import whole schedules

Plan:
1. Create a wireframe and storyboard
  - Test the look and feel of the app
2. Develop the backend aspect of the app
  - i.e. Set up servers, databases, APIs, storage solutions etc.  
3. Refine UI
  - Test the flow of the app

Possible expansion (after the initial app has been built) would be to have the same app, but on a different platform/operating system (i.e. iOS)

Step 1:
Wireframe:
