# Android-App

/*
This app is written in the Java language:

Description of app:
The app's function is to manage timetables. 
Users may be able to:
- Use different colours for events
- Set alarms for events 
- etc.
Note that the app:
- Allows easy addition of events
- Has an intuitive interface
- Allows users to import whole schedules

Plan:
1. Create a wireframe and storyboard
  - Test the look and feel of the app
2. Develop the backend aspect of the app
  - i.e. Set up servers, databases, APIs, storage solutions etc.  
3. Refine UI
  - Test the flow of the app

Possible expansion (after the initial app has been built) would be to have the same app, but on a different platform/operating system (i.e. iOS)

Step 1:
Wireframe:
- Using Justinmind to design a basic wireframe and hierarchy of information (i.e. which button leads to what screen)
Basic layout of wireframe:

Home screen 
- Shows events in the day
- Allows you to create a new event
  - New event leads to a new page -- "Create an event" screen
- Import a schedule (using various methods: Linking to Google, URL etc.) 
  
Create an event screen
- Allows you to put in date, time (i.e. start and end) and location of event
- Has 2 buttons:
  - Add the event
    - Clicking on this will lead to the "Calendar" screen (The day of the event)  
  - Cancel/ Delete
    - Clicking on this will lead back to the "Home" screen

Calendar screen
- Shows the whole day (Times will be evenly spaced out)

- Considering design of the app:
  - Simplistic
  - Specific colours for each action:
    - Red for "action"
    - Grey for "delete"
